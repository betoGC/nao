TODO
 -- Confirm aug-cc-pvtz in gaussian and psi4 contains the same basis.
 -- Have a gaussian 16 general reordering independent of the max_l.
 -- Get a test set with raw data to compare S^(AO) and P^(AO).
 -- Get the spherical averaging for the multiple shells.
 -- Added user defined basis to a path, it allows straight comparison without pre-defined sets, in order to produce a real validation test, 
    print all desired basis files and import a database.
